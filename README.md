# learning_python
Hi, I've started learing Pyhton form zero and decided to share my progress with you :) 
Here are exercises that I wrote during learning. Most of tasks are from https://www.practicepython.org/ and  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/
I'll keep adding new programs  here.

If you found any mistakes, and I'm sure you will ;) please tell me, and I will do my best to fix it
